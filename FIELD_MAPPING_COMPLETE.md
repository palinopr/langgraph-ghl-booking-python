# GHL Field Mapping Implementation Complete

## ‚úÖ What Was Done

1. **Queried GHL API** - Found 14 existing custom fields in location `sHFG9Rw6BdGh6d6bfMqG`

2. **Created Field Mapping** - `config/ghl_field_mapping.py`:
   - Mapped 5 existing fields we can reuse:
     - `preferred_day` ‚Üí D1aD9KUDNm5Lp4Kz8yAD
     - `preferred_time` ‚Üí M70lUtadchW4f2pJGDJ5
     - `customer_goal` ‚Üí r7jFiJBYHiEllsGn7jZC (repurposed from "goal")
     - `customer_budget` ‚Üí 4Qe8P25JRLW0IcZc5iOs (repurposed from "budget")
     - `customer_name` ‚Üí TjB0I5iNfVwx3zyxZ9sW (repurposed from "verified_name")
   
   - Documented 7 fields that need creation:
     - `booking_step` (Single Select Options)
     - `language` (Single Select Options)
     - `customer_pain_point` (Large Text)
     - `customer_email` (Text)
     - `appointment_id` (Text)
     - `conversation_started` (Text)
     - `last_interaction` (Text)

3. **Updated GHL State Manager** - `stateless_booking/ghl_state_manager.py`:
   - Added import for CUSTOM_FIELD_IDS
   - Updated all field references to use mapped IDs
   - Handles both existing fields (with real IDs) and placeholders gracefully

4. **Created Test Script** - `test_field_mapping.py`:
   - Verifies field mapping implementation
   - Shows which fields exist and which need creation
   - Confirms GHL State Manager initializes correctly

## üöß Next Steps for Admin

1. **Create Missing Fields in GHL**:
   ```
   Location: sHFG9Rw6BdGh6d6bfMqG
   Settings > Custom Fields
   
   Create these 7 fields:
   - Booking Step (Single Select: greeting, name, goal, pain, budget, email, day, time, scheduled, complete)
   - Language (Single Select: en, es)
   - Customer Pain Point (Large Text)
   - Customer Email (Text)
   - Appointment ID (Text)
   - Conversation Started (Text)
   - Last Interaction (Text)
   ```

2. **Update Field IDs**:
   - After creating fields, get their IDs from GHL
   - Update `config/ghl_field_mapping.py` CUSTOM_FIELD_IDS
   - Replace placeholder IDs with actual IDs

3. **Deploy to Production**:
   - System is ready for existing fields
   - Will work with new fields once created

## üéØ Current Status

- ‚úÖ Code updated to use actual GHL field IDs
- ‚úÖ System handles both existing and placeholder fields
- ‚úÖ Production-ready for fields that exist
- ‚è≥ Waiting for admin to create 7 missing fields

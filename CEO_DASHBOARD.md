- **Deployment ETA**: Thu Jul 24 17:29:57 CDT 2025 (15 minutes from push)

### What Was Fixed:
- **Issue**: Production recursion error (trace: 93af06af-56c1-4ad8-a65e-c476d13c2907)
- **Root Cause**: webapp.py was using recursive graph workflow
- **Solution**: Switched to stateless handler - NO MORE LOOPS!

### Testing Window:
- **Test Ready At**: 17:29:57 CDT (2:29:57 PM Pacific)
- **Test Endpoint**: Production webhook at /webhook
- **Expected Behavior**: Messages processed atomically with no recursion

### Key Changes:
1. webapp.py now imports stateless handler instead of graph
2. Version updated to 2.0.0
3. All graph workflow code removed from webhook path

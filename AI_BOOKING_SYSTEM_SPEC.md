# 🤖 AI BOOKING ASSISTANT - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION SPEC

## 🎯 Vision: $300/Month AI Solution (Not a Template Bot!)

This is an INTELLIGENT AI assistant that can:
- Handle ANY question about services
- Take detailed notes for sales team
- Make smart decisions about when to educate vs qualify vs book
- Remember full conversation context
- Adapt responses based on customer insights

## 📊 Current State vs Target State

### What We Have Now (Basic Bot)
```python
# Current: Rigid script following
if step == "greeting":
    return "Hi! Welcome to AI Outlet Media..."
elif step == "name":
    return "What's your name?"
# Just follows a script, no intelligence
```

### What We're Building (AI Assistant)
```python
# Target: Intelligent conversation handling
customer_message = "Do you guys do SEO?"
ai_response = await ai_assistant.process(
    message=customer_message,
    context=conversation_history,
    customer_profile=customer_insights
)
# Returns: "Yes! We specialize in local SEO. What kind of business do you have?"
# Also stores: notes, insights, next actions
```

## 🏗️ Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Critical GHL APIs (Week 1)
**Without these, NOTHING works**

#### 1.1 GHL Message Sending API
```python
class GHLMessenger:
    async def send_whatsapp_message(self, phone: str, message: str) -> bool:
        """Send message via GHL WhatsApp integration"""
        # API: POST /conversations/messages
        # Requires: locationId, contactId, type: "WhatsApp"
```

#### 1.2 GHL Conversation History API
```python
class GHLConversationManager:
    async def get_conversation_history(self, contact_id: str) -> List[Message]:
        """Get full conversation context"""
        # API: GET /conversations/search
        # Returns all messages for AI context
```

#### 1.3 Enhanced Custom Fields for AI State
```yaml
ai_custom_fields:
  # Current fields (basic)
  - booking_step
  - customer_name
  - customer_email
  
  # NEW AI fields needed
  - ai_conversation_notes     # Full AI notes (LARGE_TEXT)
  - ai_customer_insights      # Personality/preferences (LARGE_TEXT)
  - ai_pain_points           # JSON array of pain points
  - ai_interests             # Services they're interested in
  - ai_qualification_score   # 1-10 score
  - ai_objections           # Concerns to address
  - ai_next_action          # AI's recommended next step
  - ai_full_context         # Complete conversation state (JSON)
```

### Phase 2: OpenAI Integration (Week 1-2)
**The actual intelligence**

#### 2.1 AI Conversation Engine
```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory

class AIConversationEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4-turbo-preview", temperature=0.7)
        self.memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(
            llm=self.llm,
            max_token_limit=2000
        )
        
    async def process_message(
        self,
        message: str,
        conversation_history: List[Message],
        customer_state: Dict[str, Any]
    ) -> AIResponse:
        """
        Process message with full AI intelligence
        Returns: response, notes, insights, next_action
        """
        prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
            ("system", AI_SYSTEM_PROMPT),
            ("human", "Conversation history: {history}"),
            ("human", "Customer state: {state}"),
            ("human", "Customer message: {message}"),
            ("human", "Generate response and update notes")
        ])
        
        response = await self.llm.ainvoke(
            prompt.format_messages(
                history=conversation_history,
                state=customer_state,
                message=message
            )
        )
        
        return self._parse_ai_response(response)
```

#### 2.2 AI System Prompt

[Notes: Price sensitive, addressed with ROI focus, qualifying budget]

Customer: "Maybe $200"
